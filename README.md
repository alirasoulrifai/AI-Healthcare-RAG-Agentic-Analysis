AI-Driven Healthcare Analysis & Physiological Research
This repository contains the work completed during my internship at AI CoLab (Sept – Nov 2025). The project is divided into a group-led generative AI application and individual biomedical statistical research.


🚀 Group Project: AI Hospital Quality Analyst

Role: Technical Lead 

Developed an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to analyze U.S. hospital quality and ensure regulatory compliance.


Dataset: Processed 400,000+ HCAHPS survey records.


Tech Stack: Python, Ollama (Local LLM), FAISS Vector Indexing, and MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings.

Key Features:

Automated regulatory checks against CFR §482 standards.


Interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time radar and bar charts.

Implemented grounding scores to eliminate model hallucinations.

📊 Individual Project: Cardiovascular Physiology Research
Supervisor: Dr. Omar Aljawfi

Conducted statistical analysis on the effects of acute cold-water exposure on cardiac function.

Analysis: Performed paired t-tests and correlation analysis on echocardiographic parameters and ventricular strain metrics.

Automation: Developed a Python pipeline to clean mixed-format clinical data and convert fractional blood pressure strings into numerical data.

Findings: Identified significant heart rate reductions and specific alterations in cardiac delta (Δ) parameters.

🛠️ Skills & Tools

AI/ML: Generative AI, RAG Architecture, LLM Optimization (Qwen 3:8B, Gemma-3:4B).


Data Science: Pandas, Scipy, NumPy, Matplotlib.


Clinical: Echocardiographic interpretation, Healthcare Regulatory Standards
